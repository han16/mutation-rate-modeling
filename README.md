# Mutation rate modeling in human genome 

Poisson regression model will be used to learn how genomic features influence mutation rate, ideally at the single base level using de novo mutation data, with the aim of providing insight on mutagenic mechanism. 

## Step 1: Prepare baseline mutation rate
